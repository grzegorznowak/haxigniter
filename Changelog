Changelog for haXigniter


Current
=======
Features
 - haxigniter.server.libraries.DatabaseConnection now has a charSet and collation property for setting 
   client charset in MySQL databases. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-connection.html
   for more information.
 - haxigniter.server.request.RequestHandlerDecorator added, which modifies the RequestResult created by
   the RequestHandlers. HaxeRequestDecorator is an implementation that simplifies Haxe remoting over
   http.
 - RestHandler can now optionally pass the requestData object to the Controller instead of the GET/POST
   query.
 
Changed 
 - RequestHandler interface should now return a new RequestResult enum, for much greater control over 
   the request. 

v0.9 (2010-01-03)
=================
Features
 - Added haxigniter.common.libraries.ParsedUrl for convenient parsing of urls. Used in request handlers.
 - Added haxigniter.server.routing.Router, which can be sent to Application.run() to create controllers 
   for the incoming requests.
 - Added Url.segmentString(), which rewrites the request path to a proper segment string, taking
   mod_rewrite into account. Request handlers are encouraged to use this method.
 - Added haxigniter.server.routing.Alias, an early version of url path rewriting. Will support
   bidirectional aliasing later.
 - Added haxigniter.server.content.ContentHandler, an interface for transforming input and output content
   from/to a controller to different charsets, mimetypes, etc.
 - Added haxigniter.server.content.HaxeRequestContent, a content handler for remoting of haxe objects.
 - haxigniter.server.request.BasicHandler now has a property for the GET/POST data sent to it, and
   also for the posted requestData.
 - Added config.Router, so a Router can be specified in the configuration.
 - Cleaned up and commented the skeleton project files, and also the documentation for the run.n.
 - Improved development mode detection in skeleton config file.
 
Changed
 - RequestHandler interface now uses a ParsedUrl instead of just path.
 - RequestHandler interface now accepts any data instead of raw posted data, so the ContentHandler can
   modify it.
 - haxigniter.server.Controller interface is now public for all properties, instead of just read-only.
   Please update your controller class implementations.
 - The Request library now handles all external and internal requests in haXigniter.
 
Bug fixes
 - Logging RestApiExceptions in RestApiHandler now works if logger property is set.

v0.84 (2009-12-13)
==================
Features
 - doc/mod_rewrite.conf is now rewritten for Neko when ignite/init a project with -neko.

Changed
 - tests.TestRunner is removed. Added test method to dev/unittests instead.
 - siteUrl is removed from configuration file. Use Url.siteUrl() instead.
 - Behavior of Url.siteUrl() changed - no slash is added after return value anymore.
   Update your templates if you're using it there.

Bug fixes
 - Fixed a URL rewrite bug on empty requests in Apache when using mod_rewrite.

v0.83 (2009-12-06)
==================
Features
 - RestApiConfigSecurityHandler can now use a FieldValidator for access rights validation.
 - Added RestApiValidationException, to be used when data validation fails.
 - Added standard regexps in haxigniter.common.validation.Field.

Changed
 - RestApiConfigSecurityHandler now uses a password encoder function in the "userPasswordEncoder" property,
   that will be applied on the password before checking the database. Default is MD5.
 - Better error logging for exceptions derived from haxigniter.common.exceptions.Exception
 - FieldValidator callbacks (ValidationCallback) should return the new value or null for failed validation.
 - No foreign keys can be written to in RestApiConfigSecurityHandler unless stated explicitly.
 - RestApiHandler now accepts requests without api version.
 - RestApiHandler now takes the requested format at the end of the query (/resource/1.xml for example)
 - RestApiHandler can now be created without a RestApiSecurityHandler. The security handler will bypass
   its own security with this method, to avoid a circular reference.
 - haxigniter.server.libraries.DatabaseConnection now logs sql errors instead of tracing them.

Bug fixes
 - In write requests, RestApiSqlRequestHandler now uses the foreign key if it exists in the input data.
 - Data in RestApiSqlRequestHandler is now modified properly by FieldValidator callbacks.
 - Fixed a path bug in run.n.

v0.82 (2009-11-27)
==================
Features
 - Added haxigniter.common.validation.FieldValidator, for validation of user input.
 - Added IterableTools.intersection() and IterableTools.difference()

Changed
 - For developers: run.n now detects if it's running in haxelib or not. If not, the current run.n path
   is set as library path.

Bug fixes
 - ignite init failed on Linux if target directory didn't exist.
 - RestApiSqlRequestHandler didn't generate the id list properly for write requests.
 - MockDatabaseConnection can now handle an Array of mocked database results.
 - Fixed some unit tests that required the new behavior of MockDatabaseConnection.
 - Fixed some unit tests for clean Haxe 2.04.

v0.81 (2009-11-23)
==================
Features

 - "ignite nekoserver" added, for convenient web testing of a project.
 - RestApi queries now handles "*" as an "all" resource.
 - RestApiHandler now has a development property for debugging requests.
 - haxigniter.common.unit.TestRunner now has optional html output.

Bug fixes
 - ignite hxml parser found the build path in comments.
 - RestApi queries weren't counted properly.
 - haxigniter wasn't included as a lib in skel/myapp.hxproj
 - Fixed skeleton unit tests.

v0.8 (2009-11-21)
=================
Changed
 - Lots and lots. HaXigniter is now a haxelib, which makes this version quite incompatible with the older.
   Packages have moved around, it now adheres to better OO-principles, and the build tools are written in
   Neko to make them platform-independent.
   
   Updating projects written for v0.57 (last official release) and earlier is recommended, and the
   recommended way of doing that is to execute "haxelib install haxigniter" and then 
   "haxelib run haxigniter init" in an empty directory. From there you can copy your controllers to 
   "src/controllers" in the new directory, and start working from there. More information is available on 
   the web.

==================
Changed
