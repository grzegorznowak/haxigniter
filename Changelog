Changelog for haXigniter


Current

   is set as library path.

Bug fixes

v0.81 (2009-11-23)

 - haxigniter wasn't included as a lib in skel/myapp.hxproj
 - Fixed skeleton unit tests.

v0.8 (2009-11-21)
=================
Changed
 - Lots and lots. HaXigniter is now a haxelib, which makes this version quite incompatible with the older.
   Packages have moved around, it now adheres to better OO-principles, and the build tools are written in
   Neko to make them platform-independent.
   
   Updating projects written for v0.57 (last official release) and earlier is recommended, and the
   recommended way of doing that is to execute "haxelib install haxigniter" and then 
   "haxelib run haxigniter init" in an empty directory. From there you can copy your controllers to 
   "src/controllers" in the new directory, and start working from there. More information is available on 
   the web.
